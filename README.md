## ⚠️ Important: Third-Party Cookies Notice

UrbanSetu uses **separate domains for frontend and backend** (e.g., Vercel + Render).  
Because of this, authentication relies on cross-site cookies.

👉 Please ensure **third-party cookies are enabled** in your browser.  
Otherwise, login sessions may expire immediately.

This is a browser security behavior — not a bug in the app.
